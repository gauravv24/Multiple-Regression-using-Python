# Multiple-Regression-using-Python


Hi, you can use this python code to find the regression with multiple variables. It's not one of the most efficient codes but does the job pretty well.
I highly recommend you to try this out on your own. You'll definitely learn a lot of things.
Feel free to make changes to the code on your own to increase efficiency of the code and you can mail me (email given below) regarding the same in order make changes
to the repository.

Note: This code might not work for more than 5 independent variables because after that the matrix formed can be non-invertible.

The same thing can also be acheived in Octave/Matlab more efficiently but this is just a python version of it and works perfectly fine.

If you have any queries, you can reach out to me at gaurv2404@gmail.com. I'll help you out.

Cheers!
